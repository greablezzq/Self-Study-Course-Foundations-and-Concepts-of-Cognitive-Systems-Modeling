# Self-study course: Foundations and Concepts of Cognitive Systems Modeling
This course is a comprehensive course designed to provide students with the essential mathematical and computational foundations for understanding how cognitive systems work. This mathematically oriented prep course is relevant for students of psychology, computer science, mathematics, and neuroscience who want to explore the fundamental principles underlying human and artificial cognition.

This course is developed with Moodle 4.1. The both files are generated by Moodle backup function. For reuse, please check the [Moodle Documents](https://docs.moodle.org/500/en/Course_restore). The file *"Foundations and Concepts of Cognitive Systems Modeling_all material.mbz"* provides the adaptive question systems and links to online videos (YouTube videos); while the file *"Foundations and Concepts of Cognitive Systems Modeling_only adaptive question lessons.mbz"* only provides the adaptive question systems.

This course is co-funded under the 2LIKE project by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg within the funding line Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education.
